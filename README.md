## Install dependencies

This project is developed with React using npm to manage dependencies. To install them, execute

```
npm install
```

## Start the project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project by executing

```
npm start
```

## Project in production

To run the code in production mode I have created the docs folder by running npm run docs. This way the website will be available in `/ docs / public /` so you simply have to open the file index.html in the browser or [https://github.com/sandrusmb/rtl](https://github.com/sandrusmb/rtl)

## Decisions

Once the web code left to right was done, I generate the new code right to left using the reverse property of flex box for rows and columns and also I changed the direction of margins and paddings.

## Observations

I have really enjoyed and learned doing this exercise. I know there are things to improve but I am proud of the code.

I am a diamond in the rough and, although I have a lot to polish, I have talent, I am constant and hard-worker. I hope you consider it for the position.

Thank you!
